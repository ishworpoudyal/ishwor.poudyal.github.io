I completed my M.S. in Physics from Tribhuvan University, Nepal. After completing my masters, I moved to the United States for further studies. I received my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee under the supervision of Prof. Marius Schmidt and Prof. Peter Schwander. My research was based on the interaction of biological materials with X-rays with a focus on the structure determination of biological macromolecules using the time-resolved serial crystallography and single-particle imaging. After Ph.D, I moved to Argonne National Laboratory as a post-doctoral research associate where I worked on lens-based X-ray imaging technique called Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) for characterizing nanometer-scale heterogeneity in crystalline/polycrystalline materials. I was involved in a theoretical and simulation framework of lens-based coherent X-ray scattering and the experimental development of coherence-enhanced DFXM techniques at Advanced Photon Source. Currently, I am working in a semiconductor industry.
