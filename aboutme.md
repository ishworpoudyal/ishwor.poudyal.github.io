I completed my M.S. in Physics from <a href="https://tucdp.edu.np/"> Tribhuvan University,</a> Nepal. After completing my masters, I moved to the United States for further studies. I received my Ph.D. in Physics from the <a href="https://uwm.edu/"> University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee </a> under the supervision of <a href="https://uwm.edu/physics/people/schmidt-marius/"> Prof. Marius Schmidt </a> and <a href="https://uwm.edu/physics/people/schwander-peter/">Prof. Peter Schwander. </a> My research was based on the interaction of biological materials with X-rays with a focus on the structure determination of biological macromolecules using the time-resolved serial crystallography and single-particle imaging. After Ph.D, I moved to <a href="https://www.anl.gov/"> Argonne National Laboratory </a> as a post-doctoral research associate where I worked on lens-based X-ray imaging technique called Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) for characterizing nanometer-scale heterogeneity in crystalline/polycrystalline materials. I was involved in a theoretical and simulation framework of lens-based coherent X-ray scattering and the experimental development of coherence-enhanced DFXM techniques at Advanced Photon Source. Currently, I am employed at <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html"> Intel </a> as a Module Development Engineer within the Overlay Control Group.
